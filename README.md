# Omalarkey

This is a personal fork of the excellent [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy).
It starts from the same philosophy: a complete, opinionated system setup without the hassle of writing bespoke configs for every essential tool.

Turn a fresh Arch installation into my fully-configured, beautiful, and powerful systems environment based on Hyprland by running a single command.

The focus is simply shifted from web development to low-level systems and security work.
It's less about building web apps and more about understanding how things tick.

> **Note:** This project is based on Omarchy. The original [Omarchy Manual](https://manuals.omamix.org/2/the-omarchy-manual) may be a useful reference for the base system setup, but be aware that Omalarkey contains different tools and configurations specific to security work.

> **Warning:** This is intended to be run on a **fresh** Arch Linux installation. Running this on an existing system may overwrite your configuration files. This is my personal setup; use at your own risk.
